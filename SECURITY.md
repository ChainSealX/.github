## Our Commitment to Data Integrity
ChainSealX is built on the principle of immutable, verifiable data. Because our package handles decentralized ledgers and certificate-based encryption, we treat security reports with the highest priority.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

If you discover a security vulnerability within ChainSealX, please help us protect the ecosystem by reporting it privately. 

### How to report:
1. **Email:** Send a detailed report to **chainsealx@gmail.com**.
2. **Details to include:**
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (PoC code is highly appreciated).
   - The potential impact (e.g., data tampering, certificate bypass, unauthorized ledger access).

### Our Response Process:
* **Acknowledgment:** You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 24–48 hours.
* **Analysis:** Our team will validate the vulnerability and determine the severity.
* **Fix:** We will work on a patch and notify you once it is ready for testing or release.
* **Disclosure:** A public security advisory will be released only after a patch is available to all users.

## Responsible Disclosure
We ask that you do not share the vulnerability publicly until we have had a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue. We believe in "Responsible Disclosure" to protect applications currently using the ChainSealX ledger in production.
